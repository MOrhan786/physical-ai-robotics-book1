# Lesson 1: Robotics Basics

## Introduction to Robotics

Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and other disciplines to design, construct, operate, and use robots. A robot is a programmable machine that can carry out a series of actions autonomously or semi-autonomously.

### Citation Example

For more foundational information on robotics, see:

[^1]: This is a standard reference in the field of robotics, providing comprehensive coverage of fundamental concepts and advanced topics.

## Key Components of a Robot

A typical robot consists of several key components (for detailed information about each component, see [Lesson 2: Robot Components and Architecture](../intro-to-robotics/lesson-2-components)):

1. **Actuators**: These are the "muscles" of the robot, responsible for movement. Common actuators include servo motors, stepper motors, and hydraulic systems.

2. **Sensors**: These act as the robot's "senses", allowing it to perceive its environment. Common sensors include cameras, ultrasonic sensors, infrared sensors, and IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units).

3. **Controller**: The "brain" of the robot, typically a microcontroller or computer that processes sensor data and sends commands to actuators.

4. **Power Supply**: Provides energy to all components, often in the form of batteries or external power sources.

Understanding these components is crucial as we'll explore their detailed functionality and integration in the next lesson.

## Types of Robots

Robots can be classified in various ways:

- **Industrial Robots**: Used in manufacturing and assembly lines
- **Service Robots**: Assist humans in daily tasks
- **Mobile Robots**: Capable of moving around in their environment
- **Humanoid Robots**: Designed to resemble humans in form and behavior
- **Agricultural Robots**: Used in farming and agricultural applications

## The Robotics Development Process

The development of a robotic system typically follows these phases:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understanding what the robot needs to accomplish
2. **Design**: Creating mechanical, electrical, and software blueprints
3. **Implementation**: Building and programming the robot
4. **Testing**: Validating that the robot performs as expected
5. **Deployment**: Putting the robot into operation
6. **Maintenance**: Ongoing support and updates

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll explore the various components that make up robotic systems in greater detail.
