# Architecture Quality Checklist: VLA Architecture for Docusaurus Book

**Purpose**: Validate architecture plan completeness and quality before proceeding to task generation
**Created**: 2025-12-11
**Feature**: [Link to plan.md](../plan.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Architecture addresses all specified requirements (VLA pipeline, section structure, workflow, validation)
- [x] Technical decisions are justified with reasoning
- [x] Architecture is appropriate for documentation/book use case
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Architecture Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (except where appropriate)
- [x] Docusaurus structure defined (content files, sidebar, section organization)
- [x] Module granularity vs. lesson grouping addressed
- [x] Citation handling inside Markdown specified (APA format)
- [x] Asset strategy (diagrams, flow charts, pseudo-pipelines) defined
- [x] Build + deployment approach specified
- [x] Research + writing workflow defined (research-concurrent)
- [x] Quality validation plan aligned with success criteria

## Technical Validity

- [x] Technology choices are appropriate for the use case
- [x] Project structure supports the intended functionality
- [x] Performance goals are realistic for the technology stack
- [x] Constraints are properly considered in the architecture

## Implementation Readiness

- [x] Architecture provides clear guidance for implementation
- [x] Dependencies and technology stack are clearly defined
- [x] Project structure is well-organized and scalable
- [x] Architecture addresses all testing strategy requirements

## Notes

- Architecture plan is comprehensive and ready for task generation
- Docusaurus structure supports VLA pipeline documentation with clear lesson progression
- Research-concurrent workflow is accommodated in the architecture
